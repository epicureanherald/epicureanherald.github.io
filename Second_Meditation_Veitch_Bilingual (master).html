        De corpore verò ne dubitabam quidem, sed distincte me nosse arbitrabar ejus naturam, quam si forte, qualem mente concipiebam, describere tentassem, sic explicuissem: per corpus intelligo illud omne quod aptum est figurâ aliquâ terminari, loco circumscribi, spatium sic replere, ut ex eo aliud omne corpus excludat; tactu, visu, auditu, gustu, vel odoratu percipi, necnon moveri pluribus modis, non quidem a seipso, sed ab alio quopiam a quo tangatur: namque habere vim seipsum movendi, item sentiendi, vel cogitandi, nullo pacto ad naturam corporis pertinere judicabam; quinimo mirabar potius tales facultates in quibusdam corporibus reperiri.
    </td>
    <td> 
        As regarded the body, I did not even doubt of its nature, but thought I distinctly knew it, and if I had wished to describe it according to the notions I then entertained, I should have explained myself in this manner: By body I understand all that can be terminated by a certain figure; that can be comprised in a certain place, and so fill a certain space as therefrom to exclude every other body; that can be perceived either by touch, sight, hearing, taste, or smell; that can be moved in different ways, not indeed of itself, but by something foreign to it by which it is touched [and from which it receives the impression]; for the power of self-motion, as likewise that of perceiving and thinking, I held as by no means pertaining to the nature of body; on the contrary, I was somewhat astonished to find such faculties existing in some bodies.

<h1>Commentary</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p></p>

<h3>Paragraph 1</h3>

<p>Notice how incongruous this rhetoric is with the conclusion of the first meditation, where Descartes stated that he was going to force himself to adopt a skeptical hypothesis, even though he naturally falls back into common sense beliefs. Here Descartes writes that he has "fallen unexpectedly into a deep whirlpool which tumbles me around so that I can neither stand on the bottom nor swim up to the top." Is that an apt metaphor for artificially forcing oneself to doubt one's everyday beliefs? Descartes seems to have forgotten the end of the previous meditation, and has actually come to believe the evil demon hypothesis, instead of merely supposing it in the quest to see if any propositions are indubitable. Why is there such an emotional valence to his language? The reason is that Descartes is really referring here to the abolishment of the Timean-Aristotelian worldview, rather than to skepticism. What had been previously taken as a firm foundation, the Earth itself, at the center of a beautiful universe of crystal spheres spinning with mathematical order, has been replaced by the atomistic void. There is no bottom nor top, because there is no absolute up or down in the atomistic system. Descartes writes: "Archimedes used to demand just one firm and immovable point in order to shift the entire earth; so I too can hope for great things if I manage to find just one thing, however slight, that is certain and unshakeable." Descartes phrases this search as an epistemological one: he ostensibly searches for one proposition that is not susceptible to the skeptical argument. But it is actually a metaphysical search: he searches for some object in the world that the Church Fathers have not been wrong about, some object which will sustain his religious faith.</p>

<p>Descartes thus establishes a binary value structure, where Forms, Knowledge, and Christianity are goods, and Atomism, Skepticism, Atheism are evils. Of course, he will concede that substantial forms do not exist except in the case of the human soul. But he is anxious to replace the Aristotelian model of knowledge of the forms with knowledge of the underlying conditions of materialistic object, namely space, time, and the laws of nature. (Kant would be following this line of argumentation closely.)</p>

<h3>Paragraph 5</h3>

<p>This passage may be the reason why commentators have described Descartes's project as an attempt to replace Aristotelian-Aquinian hylomorphism. He describes his prior understanding of himself as a body-soul synthesis. But I think commentators have been too trusting to Descartes here. The Christian understanding of the self has always been more Platonic than Aristotelian. The Christian understanding of the self has been as a magical entity, the soul, that is immaterial and persists after death. Descartes's purported belief in a Stoic conception of the soul as an ether spread throughout the body seems disingenous. Pietro Pomponazzi's book espousing a similar view was burned, and Pomponazzi nearly burned along with it. Adherence to the belief in the immortality of the soul is ispo facto a belief in oneself as something-more-than-corporeal. Insofar as I am a bodily human at the moment, the Christian might say, I am a hylomorphic synthesis of my body and my soul, but after my death, when I am in Purgatory or Heavan, I will be pure soul. Thus Descartes's final position that man is a thinking thing is not as revolutionary as it is often presented. It is rather a retreat from hylomorphism to a more "secure" position, since hylomorphism has become suspect after the Aristotelian-Aquinian cosmology was found to be false.</p>

<p>And even Descartes's description of the body seems rather to anticipate his dualism, rather than to say what his common sense beliefs were. His description of body sounds rather like the Aristotelian prime matter, or of pure space, rather than the everyday world of macroscopic objects.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 6</h3>

<p>To Descartes's claim that "if I should wholly cease to think, that I should at the same time altogether cease to be," every undergraduate classroom will have one objector who says "but what about a dreamless sleep? I don't cease to exist during a dreamless sleep." The professor usually makes light of this objection, saying that even during your dreamless sleep you are still listening, you can be woken up by an alarm, etc. But the fact is that the professor is forced to make light of this objection because it is so devastating. There is no point in continuing on in the Meditations once you have reached this reductio ad absurdum, so the professor makes light of the objection so that the class can go on. But the truth is that there is no point in continuing on in the Mediations after this point (if we're after the truth)! Descartes's position is refuted by plain evidence, namely that we do persist even during dreamless sleep. This demonstrates that we are really our bodies; they allow for our persistence through dreamless sleep.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 7</h3>

<p>Descartes here confuses conceivability with possibility. Indeed, it is arguable that whole exercise of radical skepticism was simply a way to support premise (1) below. His argument might be explicated as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can imagine a world where I exist but in which there are no bodies.</li>
<li>If I can imagine a state of affairs, then that state of affairs is possible.</li>
<li>It is possible that I exist but there are no bodies.</li>
<li>Therefore, I am not a body.</li>
</ol>
<p>Premise (1) is false, on my view, since we are nothing but bodies. But even if we concede premise (1), premise (2) is also false. It is a delusion of grandeur to suppose that our imagination tracks metaphysical or physical possibility. Why would it? The hidden presupposition for doing so is a presupposition of our rational, semi-divine nature, which is mystically connected to God or the divine Logos. And this presupposition is a veritable cancer at the heart of contemporary Analytic philsophy. Consider David Chalmers's very similar and very influential line of argumentation in The Consious Mind. It could be summarized as:
<ol>
<li>It is logically possible for a physically identical copy of oneself to exist, but for it to lack conscious experience.</li>
<li>(2) If (1) is true, then facts about conscious experience are not identical to facts about physical constitutions.</li>
<li>(3) Therefore, facts about conscious experience are not identical to facts about physical constitutions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a lot of Analytic jargon here that Descartes did not have at his disposal, such as "logical possibility" and "facts" as entities (indeed, the metaphysically most basic entities, according to Analytic philosophers). And, yes, Chalmers was conceding that conscious facts supervene on physical facts, etc. But once you cut through all the curlicues, the argument is fundamentally the same. I can imagine myself as a non-physical being (or I can imagine a physical copy of myself that is not me), therefore I am a non-physical being. But both argument stem from the same misprision, that our imaginative capcity (which Chalmers calls "logical possibiliy") is connected to the metaphysical structure of the universe. (This fantasy dates back to at least the Ancient Stoics, and Kant would perfect it.) Thus, we are left with the same line of resistance to Chalmers's argument as to Descartes. Premise (1) is false, since concious experience is nothing but a certain electro-chemical reaction in my body. But premise (2) is also false, because the human notion of "logical possibility" has no one-to-one correspondence with the way the universe actually is. Someone like Leibniz would claim that action at a distance is logically impossible, yet it exists.</p>

<p>In addition, Descartes's argument is quasi-question begging, because it presupposes the distinctness of mind and body. He presupposes that, when he is thinking about thoughts, he is not thinking about body. But, if thoughts are nothing but brain states, then this presupposition is false. He is always thinking about bodies, and he cannot conceive of anything that is not a body. There is therefore an asymmetry in his argument, similar to the asymmetry in the dream-skepticism argument. For someone who thinks that mind and body could be distinct, the argument goes forward. For the materialist, the argument is not persuasive. Does the presupposition that mind and body are possibly distinct have any plausibility of its own, which could win over the neutrals? Clearly it does, for it still persuades today and it gave rise to a whole school of Cartesian dualists. The challenge for the Epicurean is to identify why it has prima facie persuasiveness and to attempt to deflate that. But that is the subject of a different essay.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 9</h3>

<p>It is curious that the most popular resistance to this line of argumentation is not to assert that we are our bodies, and that the unity of our bodies grounds the unity of our selves. Rather, the most hardcore Analytic and Continental philosophers (truly the most dedicated truth-seekers out there, I'm sure) resisted Descartes's arguments by saying "No, you didn't take the skeptical line far enough; the demon could be deceiving you into thinking that you really exist, when in fact you don't. All there really is is a succession of brain states or a clash of psychic forces, or whatever." It might impress the attractive-but-depressed graduate student, but it's complete rubbish.</p>

<h3>Paragraph 10</h3>

<p>It seems strange that Descartes would oscillate back to a commonsense point of view at this stage in his argument, in asserting that bodies are more distinctly known than the ego, which he had been describing. Of course, this is the true position. Bodies are more distinctly known than the ego, which is an abstract object constructed out of our 2nd-order reflections on our own mental states. It is also problematic for my thesis – that Descartes is trying primarily to resist materialism in the Meditations – that he would present a sort of materialist rebuttal to his argument here, and, particularly, that he would phrase it as something he "cannot help believing." But probably he thinks the success of the famous wax argument in the next passage is so complete that it will redound against this rebuttal completely. And Descartes did not operate on the paradigm that a commonsense view is more likely to be true; quite the reverse.</p>

<p>Is it true that we should believe less strongly in something that is susceptible to doubt than something is not susceptible to doubt? And thus that we should believe more strongly in our own existence than the existence of external bodies, as Descartes suggests? This seems like a good principle to operate under. One false presupposition, however, is that the our own existence is not susceptible to doubt. This would be hinted at in Hobbes's Objection: "Compare 'I am thinking, therefore I am thought' with 'I am walking, therefore I am a walk.'" And of course Daniel Dennett would lake make a whole career out of not just doubting his own existence, but positively denying it and offering arguments against it. But I would actually like to take issue with the principle itself, if we phrase it as "we should believe less strongly in something that is susceptible to skeptical arguments than something is not susceptible to skeptical arguments"  Skeptical arguments are strange beasts. They have a sort of social component, which is to raise our standards for what counts as knowledge – as if in self-defense – whenever we hear them. Consider a proposition like "the human mind is weak and true knowledge is unobtainable." Is this susceptible to skeptical arguments? No, because it is the skeptical conclusion. Should we believe in it more strongly than the existence of external objects? We should always keep in our mind the proposition that skeptical arguments are not evidence. And we should regulate our credences according to the evidence available, not according to the lines of argumentation available.</p>

<h3>Paragraphs 10 & 11</h3>

<p>Descartes's argument here might be explicated as:
<ol>
<li>Our perceptions of objects change whilst the objects remain the same.</li>
<li>Our intuitions of objects do not change whilst the objects remain the same.</li>
<li>If a mental faculty correctly tracks the persistence of objects through property changes, and another faculty does not, then the second faculty is more primary and fundamental than the first.</li>
<li>Therefore, intuition is more primary and fundamental than perception.</li>
</ol>
Where does this argument go wrong? It presupposes the existence of a faculty of pure mental intuition. But this faculty does not exist. Rather, we understand that the wax is same wax even though it is melted because (1) it occupies the same location as the unmelted wax and we understand from expericne that things cannot magically change location, and (2) we have had prior experience with things melting. Descartes sharpens his own guillotine here, because an inexperienced toddler would likely not understand that the melted wax is the same object as the unmelted wax, thus showing that this is learned through past sense experiences with similar objects, and not at all some sort of direct mental acquantaince with pure corporeal body. The Epicurean can present an understandable causal process whereby sense experiences produce memories and trained neural pathways that allow the human mind to make correct judgments about the persistence of the wax. Descartes, on the other hand, is forced to resort to a magical interaction between the immaterial mind and the distant body, without recourse to the intermediate causal interactions of sense perception and brain interaction.
</p>

<p>It's also worth noticing how unjustified the assertion of the faculty of mental intuition is, on Descartes's stated assumption that he is only believing in things that are indubitable. So far, his ontology only consists of a single thinking thing, since the proposition "I exist" is necessarily true whenever it's asserted by a thinking thing. But now he abruptly leaps to claiming that this thinking thing has the capacity to directly intuit 3-dimensionality and corporeality.</p>

<p>Why does Descartes feel obligated to advance the wax argument? He could have simply relied on the argument-from-conceivability to show that immaterial minds exist. Why does he feel that he needs to undermine the importance of sense perception, or conversesly, bolster the importance of pure intution? It seems plausible that it's because Descartes has realized in advance that perception will cause difficulties for his dualist system. "How to explain the interaction between the mind and the body? Shouldn't we just dispense with the idea of an immaterial mind?"" Descartes thus uses attack as the best form of defence and attempts to argue that the external world is "perceived" by the mind alone, without need for the body. Here we begin to see the retreat into the self and the reification of models (in this case Cartesian geometry) to replace ther real world, which will come to dominate Western philosophy henceforth.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It's worthing digging down to see how and why Descartes's argument goes wrong here. It's striking that his method seems so sound: pare away any propositions that are open to doubt until we reach a solid bottom of an indubitable position and then build up our philosophy from there. And yet the "solid bottom" he reaches is a falsity. How does he take a falsity for an indubitable position. It would be less notable if his conclusion, after many steps of argumentation were false. We could forgive him for that. That would just be the nature of deductive reasoning. But what he takes to be his very axiom is false!</p>

<p>But, as we will see, the flaws in his argument are well known, and were pointed out by his interlocutors in the Objections and Replies. They have thus been known for centuries. Another question arises, then, which is why his argument was, and remains to be, so persuasive. Bertrand Russell seems to just take it for granted that the 1st person starting point is the only given, and that everything must be demonstrated from that basis. David Chalmers produces nothing but more sophisticated versions of Descartes's arguments. What is their intuitive appeal, and where does it come from?</p>

The central pillar of the Epicurean doctrine is the mortality of the soul. If one becomes convinced that bodily death is also the death of the soul, and not, as Plato and nearly all other doctrines would have it, the separation of the body and the soul, other Epicurean positions become much more plausible. If there is no afterlife in which we are to live cheek by jowl with the gods, we need not trouble ourselves with trying to impress them. They are clearly not interested in rewarding our behavior in this life. 

If the soul does not live on after death, then the purported existence of other foundations for moral value become less plausible. Why is doing our duty inherently good, if there is not some period during which we will be rewarded for it? Consider a world in which acting morally led to misery for everyone concerned, and in which there is no heaven in which the moral actions will be rewarded with beatitude. Would we still say that there is inherent value in acting morally? (How convenient it is, by the way, that acting morally actually increases the happiness of everyone concerned, in the aggregate!) 

The soul's mortality also strongly implies that the soul is a body, or at least a physical object, or property of a physical object. Unless we're to believe that it's a coincidence that our immaterial mind or soul expires at the same time as our body is hit by a dump truck or whatever. (Of course, dualist and idealist positions are riddled with this problem of coincidence for all kinds of everyday events. One trip to the pub after a seminar should have been enough to refute all dualism and idealism, as Hume hinted at. I drink a particular chemical, or imagine myself drinking a chemical as the idealist would have it, and this somehow throws my immaterial soul into a significantly different state!) Accepting the postulate of a bodily soul undermines the plausibility of various metaphysical and epistemological positions. Dualism and Idealism are right out, as they directly contradict the notion of a bodily soul. But indirect realism, as an epistemological position, is also less plausible from the physicalist-monist perspective. If my experiences just are bodily states caused by a physical interaction with an external object, in what sense is this not direct? Would the indirect realist really want to argue that we are not experiencing the object, but are rather experiencing our perception of the object, given that the perception is nothing but an experience caused by the object? The indirect realist would have it that we are experiencing an...experience, and not an object? (The confusion of 2nd order mental states and 1st order mental states is at the heart of indirect realism, but that's an argument for another day.)

We should examine well the arguments for the immortality of the soul, then, and see what merit they have. Plato's Phaedo would seem to be the first instance of actual arguments being advanced for the position. No Pythagorean argument for it survives, if any was made by them. But it is worth noting at the outset that Socrates, in the Phaedo, advances the position as a piece of folk wisdom, suggesting that neither Plato nor Pythagoras invented the notion of the immortality of the soul. Rather it was part of the folk religion of ancient Greece. And, indeed, no belief is more tempting than that we will live on after our deaths. I want to believe it myself. Our survival instinct is so strong that we imagine only with great pain a world in which we no longer exist. Thus we will leap at any argument for our own immortality, no matter how implausible or half-baked. Even the local elder asserting the existence of the afterlife, without argument, has been enough for the vast majority of people to believe it. Gullibility, not the lack of endeavor or creativity, is the greatest scourge to the pursuit of truth. Humans were not built to pursue truth, after all, as Nietzsche says. They were built to unify, to form communities. 

Of course, the central flaw in all the arguments for the immortality of the soul is there is not a single shred of evidence for it, almost by definition. If there is an afterlife, it seems to be a sort of trapdoor that does not allow 2-way traffic. On the other hand, there is a kind of intuitive evidence for it, which is that our mind or soul seems to be independent of our body, even while we are alive. In one case, when we dream we have a kind of purely mental experience, which is disconnected from our waking, embodied one. We no longer need to eat, in some cases we can even fly. The comparisons with the popular conception of heaven suggest themselves. In another case, when we turn our attention to thoughts, words, concepts, etc., we can become so absorbed in them that we lose touch with the physical world. The reflexive nature of human intelligence thus itself suggests that the human mind is distinct from the body. Plato made use of this intuitive evidence for the immortality of the soul right at the beginning of the Phaedo:

"SOCRATES: And indeed the soul reasons best when none of these senses troubles it, neither hearing nor sight, nor pain nor pleasure, but when it is most by itself, taking leave of the body and as far as possible having no contact or association with it in its search for reality.
SIMMIAS: That is so.
SOCRATES: At is is then that the soul of the philosopher most disdains the body, flees from it and seeks to be by itself?" (Phaedo, 65)

Socrates is here arguing that a philosopher should not fear death, since he has endeavored to live in death throughout the entirety of his life, meaning that he has attempted to use the rational component of his soul at all times, deriving all his pleasure through that, and not the appetitive or spirited parts. Socrates is here presupposing that death is the separation of the soul from the body. Nevertheless, it is fitting that Plato begins the Phaedo this way, since it implicitly suggests that the act of philosophizing itself supports the idea that soul can exist without the body.

From an Epicurean point of view, Socrates's view appears to have the correct premises, but to draw incorrect conclusions from them. It is true that the best theorizing comes when we can maintain total focus on abstract concepts. This is why we go away by ourselves into a quiet study, after everyone has gone to sleep, to do our philosophizing. Like Montaigne did in reality, we metaphorically build ourselves a tower filled with books in which to think and write by candlelight. But this does not imply that we should "despise" bodily pleasures (Phaedo, 64). Rather, it means that we should attend to them carefully. We should go to sleep early, eat a healthy breakfast, exercise, get fresh air, satisfy all of our bodies needs so that we will feel no hunger or pain, and so that our circulation will be strong, and our mind sharp, so that we can do our best thinking. We do not philosophize best by ignoring our bodily needs, rather, we philosophize best by having the luxury to satisfy all of our bodily needs in some portion of the day so that we can devote the remaining portion to study. Socrates does not scorn pleasure, rather he scorns the more basic pleasures of eating, drinking, having sex, etc. But only so that he can maximize the pleasure he derives from philosophy. This is all in agreement with the Epicurean view. We should maximize the higher pleasures, as they are more satisfying and longer lasting, than the basic ones. But we should not have scorn for the basic ones. That is nothing but posturing. We should here interject a minor chastisement of Diogenes Laertius (or whatever later Epicurean source he used) for suggesting that Epicurus was somehow able to continue doing philosophy whilst dying of kidney stones. Rubbish. As Aristotle pointed out, philosophy requires the luxury of not having to do manual labor to support oneself, and also the luxury of being able to free oneself from pain and privation. What this suggests, then, is rather the opposite of what Plato intends. It suggests that the mind is very much part of the body. All the bodily effort needed to maintain a philosopher, not just from himself but also the laborers on which he depends, suggests that philosophizing is a very energy-intensive, unstable, physical activity, and not the soul's natural state. 

It is also poignant that Socrates did grasp that the source of pleasure was the body. The pleasure he derived from philosophy was the sense of his own power increasing, his increasing adaptiveness to his environment, and his metaphorical defeat of his sparring opponents. In the afterlife, his philosophizing would be empty and devoid of pleasure. He would either know everything already, or have no need to know anything. His sparring partners would have no ego to bruise, and so he would derive no pleasure from besting them in a debate. His desire to be free of his body, which Freud would later call the "Death Drive," is a desire to become a sort of zombie, or an artificial intelligence, a font of pure knowledge and activity but without any color or life. (I would suggest that Plato recognizes this fact, and that is why he has Socrates have his last words suggest that he is sick. Socrates means that life is a kind of sickness, but Plato, I would suggest, means that Socrates himself was not entirely healthy. But that's an argument for another day.)

Let us turn now to the actual arguments for the immortality of the soul in the Phaedo. The first begins on p.70. It is quite flimsy, even by the standard of arguments for the immortality of the soul. We might write it out explicitly like this:

(1) Whenever something becomes some property X, it must have started out as the opposite property Y.
(2) Being alive and being dead are opposite properties.
(3) Whenever something becomes alive, it must have started out dead.
(4) Therefore, our soul exists in a dead state before we are born, at which point it becomes alive.

I'm willing to grant that premises (1) through (3) are true. They seem to be true analytically based on the definition of "opposite" and "becoming." We need to understand opposite as meaning just not-X, rather than assuming that every property has some unique property which is its opposite. I can become a redhead, but what is the opposite of a redhead? We cannot say, but we can say that if "I became a redhead" is true, then the meaning of "became" guarantees that whatever color my hair was before, it was not red. However, the meanings of the words "alive" and "dead" seem to function in a way that is conducive to Socrates's argument. Anything that does not have the property "alive," we term "dead." (Although perhaps viruses exist somewhere in middle; it is immaterial for our purposes.) 

The problem with Socrates's argument is that the conclusion does not follow from the premises. My body starts out dead in the sense that my mother ingests dead, nutritive matter, which is then transformed into my living body before I am born. But this does not at all entail that I have a soul, or that my soul exists in the Underworld, or that the soul can exist without the body. Indeed, it rather suggests the opposite, since "a soul existing in a dead state" sounds a lot like a "soul alive in the Underworld." A truly dead soul would seemingly have no perceptions, thoughts, etc. If I make a table out of wood, it is not plausible to say that the table existed in a not-table state before I created the table. Rather, I created the table out of the wood. Just so, it seems more in keeping with Socrates's argument to imagine that God creates the soul ex-nihilo at the moment of our birth.

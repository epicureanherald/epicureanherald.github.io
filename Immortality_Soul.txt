The central pillar of the Epicurean doctrine is the mortality of the soul. If one becomes convinced that bodily death is also the death of the soul, and not, as Plato and nearly all other doctrines would have it, the separation of the body and the soul, other Epicurean positions become much more plausible. If there is no afterlife in which we are to live cheek by jowl with the gods, we need not trouble ourselves with trying to impress them. They are clearly not interested in rewarding our behavior in this life. 

If the soul does not live on after death, then the purported existence of other foundations for moral value become less plausible. Why is doing our duty inherently good, if there is not some period during which we will be rewarded for it? Consider a world in which acting morally led to misery for everyone concerned, and in which there is no heaven in which the moral actions will be rewarded with beatitude. Would we still say that there is inherent value in acting morally? (How convenient it is, by the way, that acting morally actually increases the happiness of everyone concerned, in the aggregate!) 

The soul's mortality also strongly implies that the soul is a body, or at least a physical object, or property of a physical object. Unless we're to believe that it's a coincidence that our immaterial mind or soul expires at the same time as our body is hit by a dump truck or whatever. (Of course, dualist and idealist positions are riddled with this problem of coincidence for all kinds of everyday events. One trip to the pub after a seminar should have been enough to refute all dualism and idealism, as Hume hinted at. I drink a particular chemical, or imagine myself drinking a chemical as the idealist would have it, and this somehow throws my immaterial soul into a significantly different state!) Accepting the postulate of a bodily soul undermines the plausibility of various metaphysical and epistemological positions. Dualism and Idealism are right out, as they directly contradict the notion of a bodily soul. But indirect realism, as an epistemological position, is also less plausible from the physicalist-monist perspective. If my experiences just are bodily states caused by a physical interaction with an external object, in what sense is this not direct? Would the indirect realist really want to argue that we are not experiencing the object, but are rather experiencing our perception of the object, given that the perception is nothing but an experience caused by the object? The indirect realist would have it that we are experiencing an...experience, and not an object? (The confusion of 2nd order mental states and 1st order mental states is at the heart of indirect realism, but that's an argument for another day.)

We should examine well the arguments for the immortality of the soul, then, and see what merit they have. Plato's Phaedo would seem to be the first instance of actual arguments being advanced for the position. No Pythagorean argument for it survives, if any was made by them. But it is worth noting at the outset that Socrates, in the Phaedo, advances the position as a piece of folk wisdom, suggesting that neither Plato nor Pythagoras invented the notion of the immortality of the soul. Rather it was part of the folk religion of ancient Greece. And, indeed, no belief is more tempting than that we will live on after our deaths. Our survival instinct is so strong that we imagine only with great pain a world in which we no longer exist. Thus we will leap at any argument for our own immortality, no matter how implausible or half-baked. Even the local elder asserting the existence of the afterlife, without argument, has been enough for the vast majority of people to believe it. Gullibility, not the lack of endeavor or creativity, is the greatest scourge to the pursuit of truth. Humans were not built to pursue truth, after all, as Nietzsche says. They were built to unify, to form communities. 

Of course, the central flaw in all the arguments for the immortality of the soul is there is not a single shred of evidence for it, almost by definition. Well, perhaps that's putting it too strongly.

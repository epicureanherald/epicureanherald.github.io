Philoponus replaced
Aristotle’s explanation with one that invoked an incorporeal impressed force,
which he believed was imparted to the projectile by the motive force, when
the latter was brought into contact with the former. For a translation of Philoponus’s argument, see Morris R. Cohen and I. E. Drabkin, eds. A
Source Book in Greek Science (New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1948), 223

Avi-
cenna, for example, regarded mail as a permanent quality that would endure
in a moving body forever if there were no external resistances to the motion

The most significant parts of Buridan’s question [about impetus] are translated and commented on in Marshall
Clagett, The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages (Madison: University of Wisconsin
Press, 1959), 532–540. Clagett’s translation and commentary are reprinted in Grant, A Source

The lecture was given by a chemist called Chandoux before an audience that included Descartes and Bérulle, at the home in Paris of the Papal Nuncio, probably in the autumn of 1627.

If you want to read more about this, a good book I would recommend is The Beginnings of Western Science.

The discussion in the 1630 Mersenne Letters, in which Descartes first
mentions his “little treatise on Metaphysics”, also involves a “wicked book” (fr. meschant
livre), which Descartes thought included atheistic content and initially saw needed a reply
while boasting to have discovered a proof for God’s existence “with more certainty than
[…] any proposition of geometry” (AT I, 145, 148–149, 181–182; CSMK, 22–24, 29).
Some people, myself included, suspect this book to have been none other than Le
Vayer’s Dialogues, whose first edition came out that year, setting for Descartes a model
of skepticism to be answered (see, e.g., Paganini 2008a; 2008b).

Amphitheatrum aeternae providentiae divino-magicum Christiano-Physicum, nec non Astrologo-Catholicum (Lugduni, 1616).

A rich body of manuscripts was analysed in Winfried Schröder, Ursprünge des
Atheismus. Untersuchungen zur Metaphysik- und Religionskritik des 17. und 18.
Jahrhunderts (Stuttgart: Fromman-Holzboog, 1998), 395–526

Another key figure in this time of research and fresh editions
is Gianluca Mori, whose critical edition of L’Examen de la religion by Du
Marsais 29 and collection of texts edited with Alain Mothu, Philosophes sans
Dieu,30 deserve mention. Sergio Landucci has published a critical edi-
tion of La Lettre de Thrasybule à Leucippe, which he attributes to Fréret,31
Antonella Del Prete has published the Traité de l’infini créé by Terrasson 32
and Bertram E. Schwarzbach the Examens de la Bible by Madame Du
Châtelet.33

 it is a feature of philosophical reflection in this period by natural scientists, like Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–94), that they reject Schelling's and Hegel's speculative philosophy.

        1. Animadverti jam ante aliquot annos quàm multa, ineunte aetate, falsa pro veris admiserim, & quàm dubia sint quaecunque istis postea superextruxi, ac proinde funditus omnia semel in vitâ esse evertenda, atque a primis fundamentis denuo inchoandum, si quid aliquando firmum & mansurum cupiam in scientiis stabilire;

        1. Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the sciences.

        But as this enterprise appeared to me to be one of great magnitude, I waited until I had attained an age so mature as to leave me no hope that at any stage of life more advanced I should be better able to execute my design.

        To-day, then, since I have opportunely freed my mind from all cares [and am happily disturbed by no passions], and since I am in the secure possession of leisure in a peaceable retirement, I will at length apply myself earnestly and freely to the general overthrow of all my former opinions.

<h1>Commentary</h1>

<p>The background for this Meditation is often interpreted as Descartes's rejection of Scholasticism, and, in particular, hylomorphic metaphysics. These are taken to be the "many false opinions" that Descartes has taken for true. But I have found it more useful to interpret the worldview that Descartes seeks to reject to be the Christian, geocentric worldview. What had recently changed in Europe was that Galileo had poked holes in scholastic physics, by demonstrating that the celestial spheres are not perfect or immutable, and that impetus did not exist. This gave people reason to doubt the Aquinian world-view, and thus, by proxy, the Catholic Church. But what Descartes knows, that other people do not yet know, is that the geocentric worldview is incorrect and that the Coperican worldview is true. This represented a threat to the Christian religion itself, since a moving earth contradicts the Bible directly.</p>

<p>Much has been made of a resurgence in interest in the ancient Atomists, Epicureans, and Stoics. Of course, the preservation of Diogenes Laertius meant that the Epicurean program had been freely available to anyone that was interested throughout the Middle Ages. People were not yet interested, though, because the Platonic and eventually Aquinian worldview had greater explanatory power (in addition to the obvious atheistic implications of Epicureanism). But now anomolous evidence had arisen for the Aquinian theory, and ancient materialism was an obvious alternative theory. And Beeckman, Gassendi, and others in the Mersenne circle (including of course Descartes himself) had already been engaged in fleshing out a new corpuscular-mechanical natural philosophy. Thus, Descartes knew that some form of ancient Atomism would replace the Aquinian worldview in Europe.</p>

<p>The revolution had already happened, you might say. The Meditations, on this interpretation, are not a revolutionary piece of work, as they are often presented in the philosophy classroom. Rather, they are a conservative work. Descartes has recognized the threat posed by the new materialist worldview to the Christian religion. And the Meditations are an attempt to mediate this threat (they should have been called the "Mediations"). </p>

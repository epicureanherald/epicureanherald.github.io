        1. Several years have now elapsed since I first became aware that I had accepted, even from my youth, many false opinions for true, and that consequently what I afterward based on such principles was highly doubtful; and from that time I was convinced of the necessity of undertaking once in my life to rid myself of all the opinions I had adopted, and of commencing anew the work of building from the foundation, if I desired to establish a firm and abiding superstructure in the sciences.

<h1>Commentary</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Descartes proposes a restructuring of all his beliefs. To do so, he undertakes (or purports to undertake) a process of radical doubt, imagining that a powerful malignant demon is deceiving him about all his beliefs, or at least those that can be doubted. He claims that beliefs about the external world are susceptible to doubt, noting that the senses sometimes deceive us. Think of an optical illusion here, or mistaking the identity of a distant object. And he also claims, or at least toys with the idea, that geometrical and mathematical knowledge is also susceptible to doubt. He proposes to use this skeptical method to locate any beliefs which are indubitable.</p>

<h3>Paragraphs 1-8</h3>

<p>The background for this Meditation is often interpreted as Descartes's rejection of Scholasticism, and, in particular, hylomorphic metaphysics. These are taken to be the "many false opinions" that Descartes has taken for true. But I have found it more useful to interpret the worldview that Descartes seeks to reject to be the Christian, geocentric worldview. What had recently changed in Europe was that Galileo had poked holes in scholastic physics, by demonstrating that the celestial spheres are not perfect or immutable. This gave people reason to doubt the Aquinian world-view, and thus, by proxy, the Catholic Church. But what Descartes knows, that other people do not yet know, is that the geocentric worldview is incorrect and that the Coperican worldview is true. This represented a threat to the Christian religion itself, since a moving earth contradicts the Bible directly.</p>

<p>Much has been made of a resurgence in interest in the ancient Atomists, Epicureans, and Stoics. Of course, the preservation of Diogenes Laertius and Cicero meant that the Epicurean program had been freely available to anyone that was interested throughout the Middle Ages. The rediscovery of Lucretius may have led to a more widespread readership of Epicureanism, but nothing like the great awakening that other scholars have claimed. People were not yet interested, though, because the Platonic and eventually Aquinian worldview had greater explanatory power (in addition to the obvious atheistic implications of Epicureanism). But now anomolous evidence had arisen for the Aquinian theory, and ancient materialism was an obvious alternative theory. And Beeckman, Gassendi, and others in the Mersenne circle (including of course Descartes himself) had already been engaged in fleshing out a new corpuscular-mechanical natural philosophy. Thus, Descartes knew that some form of Atomism would replace the Aquinian worldview in Europe.</p>

<p>Thus, the revolution had already happened, you might say. The Meditations, on this interpretation, are not a revolutionary piece of work, as they are often presented in the philosophy classroom. Rather, they are a conservative work. Descartes has recognized the threat posed by the new materialist worldview to the Christian religion. And the Meditations are an attempt to mediate this threat. </p>

<p>In the Meditations, although Descartes pretends to adopt a empiricist point of view ("All that I have, up to this moment, accepted as possessed of the highest truth and certainty, I received either from or through the senses."), he is really aiming to undermine his readers' naive realism. One may take his word that his purpose in doing so is to rebuild philosophy from the ground up after removing all beliefs in Scholasticism. I would purpose a more devious interpretation of his intention, which is to undermine the possibility of a purely materialistic philosophy. We note that Descartes has no real sympathy for skepticism. He never engages with skepticism except in the Mediations, and even then only in the early Meditations. He merely enlists the help of skepticism in order to weaken his readers' naive realism about external objects. This will pave the way to the retreat into the self that begins in the Second Meditation.</p>

<p> In paragraphs 1 through 6, Descartes gradually ratchets up the skeptical program. He begins with providing some reasons to doubt the veracity of the senses, namely that they are sometimes in error. But the clever reader may have noticed that we have to presuppose the ultimate accuracy of the senses in order to establish the deception in the first place. (When we get closer to the object, we correctly identify it, still using our eyes, of course.) Thus the skeptical "argument from illusion" itself presupposes the ulimate veracity of the senses. Descartes then presents the "argument from dreaming," which basically states that, because of the similarity of dream states and perceptual states, we cannot be sure that we are awake and having true perceptual experiences. This argument, too, is unsound. There is an asymmetry in the dreaming state and the waking state, as Hobbes would point out in his objection the Meditation. When we are dreaming, we don't know whether we are dreaming or not. But when we are awake, we do know whether we're dreaming or not. But Descartes makes a different reply to the argument, writing that we must of at some time have had some basic perceptions in order to supply the raw material for our dreams. These basic perceptions, he says, include "corporeal nature in general and its extension; the figure of extended things, their quantity or magnitude, and their number, as also the place in, and the time during, which they exist, and other things of the same sort." Kant would later embark on the same project as Descartes, namely that of preserving the Christian faith in the face of Atomist (or Neo-Stoic) challenges to it (also using responding to skepticism as a pretext). And here we may see some inspiration for his Categories.</p>

<p>This response, Descartes says, means that the empricial sciences like Physics, Astronomy, and Medicine are open to skeptical doubts, but that Arithmetic and Geometry are not. But notice how the line of argumentation also leads us inward into the human mind. He effectively cedes the ground about knowledge of the external world to the skeptic, on the basis of his reply to the unsound "argument from dreaming," (which is not the only reply that could be made). We are left with a world of abstract shapes in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, changing according to a 1-dimensional timeline. (The connection between Descartes's metaphysics and his mathematical projects rears its head.) But, what all of modern philosophy did not keep in its mind, (and even most of contemporary philosophy), is that this is not the real external world. This is a model of the external world, or, in other words an abstract object, which exists only in the mind. Descartes rhetoric thus nicely dovetails with his overall purpose. His overall purpose is to remind his readers of their belief in the immortal soul, which remains untouched by Galilieo's or Copericus's discoveries, and to found a new Christian metaphysics there. And his rhetoric serves to drive our search for a firm epistemological foundation for our beliefs to the a priori, geometrical and arithmetical truths, which are mental objects. It's a top notch bit of rhetoric, which has been persuading people for centuries. It (coupled with a desire to shore up Christianity) sets up a philosophical momentum that will lead through Spinoza and Leibniz to Kant, and from there to Fichte, Hegel, and German idealism. It will take until the 20th century to be stopped, when G. E. Moore brilliantly refutes it by pointing out that our belief in an external world filled with commonplace objects is more secure than our belief in any premise of a skeptical or idealist argument. (And even then, Descartes's rhetoric seems not to have lost its power, even over Moore's collaborator Bertrand Russell. But that's the subject for another day.)</p>

<h3>Paragraphs 9-10</h3>

In these paragraphs, Descartes's argument makes a turn that seem perplexing. He even takes God to task for making us susceptible to optical illusions! He raises two possibilities: (1) that the external world does not really exist but that God puts the ideas of it into my mind (Bishop Berkeley was taking notes here); and (2) that God deceives us each time we perform an arithmetical calculation, so that, for example two plus two really equals five, but we are always deceived in thinking that it equals four.  This, Descartes seems to say, makes all propositions open to doubt. He anticipates the reply, which is that God does not exist. And it is telling that he phrases the reply in terms of Stoicism and Epicureanism: "whether by fate, or chance, or by an endless series of antecedents and consequents." This reveals that he has this alternative worldview at the front of his mind. His reply is weak. (Naturally, since the Epicurean worldview is the one most supported by the evidence.) He states that even in the Epicurean worldview, all propositions could be open to doubt since, in the absence of a divine creator, we could be such imperfect beings that our senses and logical faculties would be capable of error. Descartes thus arrives at the truth, although he takes it to be a reductio ad absurdum. Our senses and, even more so, or logical faculties are capable of error. But does this mean that there is no such thing as knowledge? No, because knowledge does not require absolute certainty. His initial premise that knowledge requires absolute certainty is false. Absolute certainty is impossible.

<h3>Paragraphs 11-12</h3>

The choice of the "malignant demon" intially seems amusing. This is because, we were taught as undergrads as though Descartes were an enlighted scientist, choosing the metaphor for semi-comic effect. All the reliance on God in the later Meditations is viewed as only a crutch. But if we instead suppose Descartes to be first and foremost a Christian, the metaphor takes on a new valence. It might represent the Satanic forces that had caused Christendom to believe in a false worldview for all those centuries. Or it might represent the current Atheists, whom Descartes is attempting to counter.

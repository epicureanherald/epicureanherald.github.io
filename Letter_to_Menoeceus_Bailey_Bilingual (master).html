<h3>Source</h3>
The Greek and English texts are both from from "Epicurus: The Extant Remains" (1926), compiled and translated by Cyril Bailey.

        Wherefore both when young and old a man must study philosophy, that as he grows old he may be young in blessings through the grateful recollection of what has been, and that in youth he may be old as well, since he will know no fear of what is to come.

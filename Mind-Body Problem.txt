Once one either becomes too sophisticated to place much credence in arguments for the existence of the soul, or embraces the philosophical Protestantism of Kant such that the existence of soul is no longer an appropriate philosophical question, one becomes interested in the mind-body problem. As David Chalmers puts it, despite the great scientific advances in the understanding of the human body and brain, "it still seems utterly mysterious that the causation of behavior should be accompanied by a subjective inner life" (Chalmers, The Conscious Mind, xi) Instead of the existence of a super-added entity -- the soul -- seeming necessary to explain self-motion, desire, cognition, and other features of living organisms, the mind-body postulates a super-added dimension, or plane of existence, or some I-know-not-what in order to account for the fact of human experience. Again, Chalmers writes:

We have good reason to believe that consciousness arises from physical systems such as brains, but we have little idea how it arises, or why it exists at all. How could a physical system such as a brain also be an experiencer? Why should there be something it is like to be such a system? Present-day scientific theories hardly touch the really difficult questions about consciousness. We do not just lack a detailed theory; we are entirely in the dark about how consciousness fits in the natural order.

I'm going to argue that the existence of the mind-body problem depends upon fallacious reasoning, and that this reasoning depends for its plausibility on the fact that we are the objects of the argument, i.e., that we possess self-consciousness, and on the same fact that lends plausibility to the arguments for the existence of the soul: that our experience of thought is not accompanied by a bodily sensation.

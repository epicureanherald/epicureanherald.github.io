Once one either becomes too sophisticated to place much credence in arguments for the existence of the soul, or embraces the philosophical Protestantism of Kant such that the existence of soul is no longer an appropriate philosophical question, one becomes interested in the mind-body problem. As David Chalmers puts it, despite the great scientific advances in the understanding of the human body and brain, "it still seems utterly mysterious that the causation of behavior should be accompanied by a subjective inner life" (Chalmers, The Conscious Mind, xi) Instead of the existence of a super-added entity -- the soul -- seeming necessary to explain self-motion, desire, cognition, and other features of living organisms, the mind-body postulates a super-added dimension, or plane of existence, or some I-know-not-what in order to account for the fact of human experience. Again, Chalmers writes:

	We have good reason to believe that consciousness arises from physical systems such as brains, but we have little idea how it arises, or why it exists at all. How could a physical system such as a brain also be an experiencer? Why should there be something it is like to be such a system? Present-day scientific theories hardly touch the really difficult questions about consciousness. We do not just lack a detailed theory; we are entirely in the dark about how consciousness fits in the natural order. (Chalmers, The Conscious Mind, xi)

I'm going to argue that the existence of the mind-body problem depends upon fallacious reasoning, and that this reasoning depends for its plausibility on the fact that we are the objects of the argument, i.e., that we possess self-consciousness, and on the same fact that lends plausibility to the arguments for the existence of the soul: that our experience of thought is not accompanied by a bodily sensation.

Our starting point should be to inquire why it is that someone who is quite ready to reject Cartesian dualism as insupportable is nonetheless unsatisfied with the proposition that consciousness in not physical. To manufacture a philosophical problem is actually the easiest thing in the world. One must only ask, of one of the features of some physical object, why the object has that feature or how the object has that feature. If that feature turns out to be a non-obvious essential feature, a philosophical problem will be created. Thus, I might ask "how do electrons have charge?" or "why do electrons have charge?" I might go on to say "we have good reason to believe that charge arises from physical systems such as electrons, but we have little idea how it arises, or why it exists at all." These questions seem to be overly demanding. Perhaps one might argue that we will eventually have an answer to the how question, once we sufficiently understand the composition of electrons in terms of their more basic constituents, or their interaction with a physical field, etc. That would be about as edifying as the explanation that electrons are massive because they contain graviton particles, or bend space-time. It would simply push the question on to a different physical object. But consider the how question with respect to consciousness. We have little idea how consciousness arises from the physical structure of our brain, Chalmers says. We have a little? I would love to hear the little. "How could a physical system such as a brain also be an experiencer?" We must consider whether there is any possible explanation that would satisfy this question. Try to imagine one. I would remind you that it is not even possible to give an exact equation for the quantum mechanical wave-function of a single, isolated carbon atom. One can only give a numerical approximation. And this is a mathematical limitation, not a technological or intellectual limitation. How much more absurd it is, then, to imagine explaining the interaction of billions of neurons in such a fashion that consciousness (and self-consciousness) pops out. It makes me laugh when I read Chalmers's hopes for a future theory of consciousness:

	I am an optimist about consciousness: I think that we will eventually have a theory of it, and in this book I look for one. But consciousness is not just business as usual; if we are to make progress, the first thing we must do is face up to the things that make the problem so difficult. Then we can move forward toward a theory, without blinkers and with a good idea of the task at hand. (Chalmers, The Conscious Mind, xi)

I do not mean to pick on Chalmers specifically, especially as this was a young, go-get-'em Chalmers, bright eyed and bushy tailed. He is merely a stand-in for all the young analytic philosophers out there that make contemporary philosophical literature so unbearable, and especially those that advocate for the existence of a mind-body problem. But there is so much to unpack here. The sad illusion that analytic philosophers have that what they do is any way comparable to the work of natural scientists. Chalmers thinks that he begins a "theory" of consciousness with this book. If by theory, he just means some words about the topic, then fine, but why use such a grandiose word? Certain changes in the physical condition of the brain can predictably cause a change in consciousness, but consciousness is not reducible to the physical condition of the brain. I'm not sure that counts as a theory. It's a proposition, certainly. (p.277)

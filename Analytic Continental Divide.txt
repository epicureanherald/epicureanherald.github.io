Epicureanism may be the least popular view in European history, or at least the most reviled. Dante famously viewed the Epicureans in the final circle of Hell, a strangely honorable position, given how unpopular the view was in the Middle Ages. It seems to have almost been forgotten about. It's worth inquiring whether Epicureanism is unpopular (despite being the view that is most in line with all of our evidence) because most people have a constitutional need to believe in the immaterial. Or whether the Platonic-Christian worldview is simply so deeply embedded in the European mind that it is only with great difficulty that the belief in the immaterial can be purged from our mental framework. It is suggestive that the peak of popularity for Epicureanism seems to have coincided with the peak of the Roman Republic, just before the rise of Christianity. On the other hand, we can see in Cicero and in Plutarch the same unwillingness to believe in only the physical world, that we later see in Christian and post-Christian writers. (I use the phrase "post-Christian" to identify writers who are ostensibly atheists, or who at least attempt to separate their religious beliefs from the philosophical beliefs, but who are nonetheless unable to escape from the Platonic-Christian paradigm simply because their minds were fixed in it in childhood.)

Epicureanism may be the least popular view in European history, or at least the most reviled. Dante famously viewed the Epicureans in the final circle of Hell, a strangely honorable position, given how unpopular the view was in the Middle Ages. It seems to have almost been forgotten about. It's worth inquiring whether Epicureanism is unpopular (despite being the view that is most in line with all of our evidence) because most people have a constitutional need to believe in the immaterial. Or whether the Platonic-Christian worldview is simply so deeply embedded in the European mind that it is only with great difficulty that the belief in the immaterial can be purged from our mental framework. It is suggestive that the peak of popularity for Epicureanism seems to have coincided with the peak of the Roman Republic, just before the rise of Christianity. On the other hand, we can see in Cicero and in Plutarch the same unwillingness to believe in only the physical world, that we later see in Christian and post-Christian writers. (I use the phrase "post-Christian" to identify writers who are ostensibly atheists, or who at least attempt to separate their religious beliefs from the philosophical beliefs, but who are nonetheless unable to escape from the Platonic-Christian paradigm simply because their minds were fixed in it in childhood.)

Kant was so terrified of the neo-Epicurean ontology raised again by Hobbes and Newton that he made the ultimate sacrifice to maintain Christianity, taking Protestantism to its logical conclusion in the process, by apparently conceding that the notion of a soul, a God, an afterlife, were not empirically supportable concepts. Yes, he said, the world looks to all intents and purposes, like the Epicureans say it is. But, if it were, there would not be morality in the sense that I understand it and I would not live forever. Therefore, there must be another dimension, as it were, where I exist outside of time and space. And that is where God exists as well. And this phenomenal world only appears to have a stable structure and obeys laws because of the structure of the human soul, as arranged by God. Kant obfuscated it as much as he could, but of course he still has some magical elements in his philosophy - namely the process by which the human mind orders the chaos of sensations into a structured phenomenal world. Readers are so dazzled by the baroque structure of the 1st Critique and its impressive array of arguments and concepts that they forget to ask about how this ordering occurs. It occurs by magic! It is really no better than Descartes's pineal gland. 

The human mind is not constructed to seek the truth. It is constructed to seek for joy. And, as the father of any young child knows, nothing brings more joy than believing in magic. After all, we do possess a kind of magic in our ability to control our own body. We want a cookie? We can make our arm move to grab the cookie. Why, then, could not the human mind categorize and order a chaotic stream of perceptions that was presented to it and thereby construct the phenomenal world? Or why could not I apply a magical veneer to an action by doing it out of duty, and imbue with the magical quality of being good? Or why could I not I survive the death of my body? Magic lies deep in our psychology and one must be disciplined in order to purge it out. Even the logical positivists could not do it, because they still wished to impose, through the sheer force of their wills, meaninglessness on meaningful statements. The most fundamental concept of causation we have is agent causation, and so we must be forever on our guard for creating little homunculi to serve as agent-causes for natural phenomena. But in the case of transcendental idealism, we are the agents, although we do not know it ourselves. All the categorization happens below the level of, or prior to, our consciousness.

This little compressed kernel of remnant magical thinking, which Kant was unable to expel from his natural philosophy (or else it would not have remained Christian) is the source of the Analytic-Continental divide in philosophy and all the trouble that has emanated from it. Despite all the rhetoric about the death of metaphysics, the root of the divide is metaphysical. The key question is whether the physical world is metaphysically prior to the conscious world, or whether the conscious world is metaphysically prior to the physical world. If one believes the latter, and that something unconscious (but not physical) gives rise to to the conscious world, whether it be the world-spirit, desires, language, culture, etc., then one is a Continental. If one doesn't (or if one wishes to further interrogate the meaning of the proposition before one assents to anything), then one is likely an Analytic. The distinction should really be between Continental and non-Continental philosophers. If one accepts some form of neo-Kantian transcendental idealism (perhaps without even knowing it oneself), then one is a Continental. If not, one is a non-Continental. But to be Analytic carries the further implication that philosophy needed to be reinvented in the early 20th century.

Epicureanism may be the least popular view in European history, or at least the most reviled. Dante famously viewed the Epicureans in the final circle of Hell, a strangely honorable position, given how unpopular the view was in the Middle Ages. It seems to have almost been forgotten about. It's worth inquiring whether Epicureanism is unpopular (despite being the view that is most in line with all of our evidence) because most people have a constitutional need to believe in the immaterial. Or whether the Platonic-Christian worldview is simply so deeply embedded in the European mind that it is only with great difficulty that the belief in the immaterial can be purged from our mental framework. It is suggestive that the peak of popularity for Epicureanism seems to have coincided with the peak of the Roman Republic, just before the rise of Christianity. On the other hand, we can see in Cicero and in Plutarch the same unwillingness to believe in only the physical world, that we later see in Christian and post-Christian writers. (I use the phrase "post-Christian" to identify writers who are ostensibly atheists, or who at least attempt to separate their religious beliefs from the philosophical beliefs, but who are nonetheless unable to escape from the Platonic-Christian paradigm simply because their minds were fixed in it in childhood.)

Kant was so terrified of the neo-Epicurean ontology raised again by Hobbes and Newton that he made the ultimate sacrifice to maintain Christianity, taking Protestantism to its logical conclusion in the process, by apparently conceding that the notion of a soul, a God, an afterlife, were not empirically supportable concepts. Yes, he said, the world looks to all intents and purposes, like the Epicureans say it is. But, if it were, there would not be morality in the sense that I understand it and I would not live forever. Therefore, there must be another dimension, as it were, where I exist outside of time and space. And that is where God exists as well. And this phenomenal world only appears to have a stable structure and obeys laws because of the structure of the human soul, as arranged by God. Kant obfuscated it as much as he could, but of course he still has some magical elements in his philosophy - namely the process by which the human mind orders the chaos of sensations into a structured phenomenal world. Readers are so dazzled by the baroque structure of the 1st Critique and its impressive array of arguments and concepts that they forget to ask about how this ordering occurs. It occurs by magic! It is really no better than Descartes's pineal gland.

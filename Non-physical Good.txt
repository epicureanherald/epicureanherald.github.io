The nonexistence of nonphysical moral goodness is probably the one tenet of Epicureanism that is most counterintuitive. It seems to be baked into human society to believe that certain of our actions possess a sort of magical property -- analogous to some objects which possess an electric charge -- that entails consequences. Sacrifice to and honor the gods and they will favor you. Desecrate a temple and the gods will punish you. I'm not an anthropologist, but my understanding is that most cultures have something like this worldview. It also seems baked into this worldview that your actions are in view of other persons. In order for morality to exist, of course, other persons must exist (or else whom could we wrong?). But the actions acquire their magical status, in part, perhaps because they get associated with this sort of "action at a distance" of the gods watching us from afar. Our moral sense is somehow entangled with our consciousness of ourselves as inhabiting a world with other conscious beings. It is reminiscent of the foundational problem with Sartre's existentialist metaphysics. If I am master of my own actions, if I can invent my own morality from scratch, why should the one I invent be at all concerned with the feelings of other people? Why should I treat other people as morally significant? I once attempted to solve this problem on Sartre's behalf by arguing that consciousnesses depends upon a consciousnesses-of-others, that our own conscious experience arises out of our coming to understand that we are an object with respect to others' conscious experience. But I would no longer subscribe to that sort of Continental-style argument that treats the structure of conscious as metaphysically primary. I would now say that conscious experience arises out of our mental structure and the inputs provided by experience. The last baby, kept alive in a nourishment vat after the death of the human race, would still become a conscious being. Albeit a very stupid and twisted one.  

What gives rise to our feeling that morality is supernatural is the nature of our social interactions in a world of finite resources. One example is the notion of debt. If we steal something from the neighboring tribe, there is created an abstract object in the minds of both tribes that we need to keep track of. Namely, the debt that we now "owe" to the other tribe. We need to keep track of it

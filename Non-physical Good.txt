The nonexistence of nonphysical moral goodness is probably the one tenet of Epicureanism that is most counterintuitive. It seems to be baked into human society to believe that certain of our actions possess a sort of magical property -- analogous to some objects which possess an electric charge -- that entails consequences. Sacrifice to and honor the gods and they will favor you. Desecrate a temple and the gods will punish you. I'm not an anthropologist, but my understanding is that most cultures have something like this worldview.

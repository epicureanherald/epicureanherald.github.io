<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Kant begins the Transcendental Aesthetic by stating a basic commitment to empiricism. He then Kant establishes a three-part division of the composition of a phenomenon, i.e., an object of sensory perception: (1) the conceptions of understanding, (2) sensation, and (3) pure intuition. The conceptions of understanding are supposed to be purely intellectual concepts. His examples are "substance, force, and divisibility." Sensation is supposed to be purely sensual experiences, such as impenetrability, hardness (two tactile sense experiences), and color (a visual sense experience). Pure intuition is whatever is left over from removing (1) and (2) from a phenomenon. And Kant asserts that this is extension and shape. Thus pure intuition could be thought of as the experience of residing in a 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space, inhabited by objects of various shapes and sizes. Kant also asserts that time belongs to pure intuition, but he doesn't yet elaborate on that.</p>

<h2>Transcendental Doctrine of Elements - Part First - Transcendental Aesthetic</h2>
<h3>§ 1. Introductory.</h3>

<p class='indent'>In whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to objects, it is at least quite clear, that the only manner in which it immediately relates to them, is by means of an intuition. To this as the indispensable groundwork, all thought points. But an intuition can take place only in so far as the object is given to us. This, again, is only possible, to man at least, on condition that the object affect the mind in a certain manner. The capacity for receiving representations (receptivity) through the mode in which we are affected by objects, is called sensibility. By means of sensibility, therefore, objects are given to us, and it alone furnishes us with intuitions; by the understanding they are thought, and from it arise conceptions. But all thought must directly, or indirectly, by means of certain signs, relate ultimately to intuitions; consequently, with us, to sensibility, because in no other way can an object be given to us.</p>

<p class='indent'>The effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as we are affected by the said object, is sensation. That sort of intuition which relates to an object by means of sensation, is called an empirical intuition. The undetermined object of an empirical intuition, is called phænomenon. That which in the phænomenon corresponds to the sensation, I term its matter; but that which effects that the content of the phænomenon can be arranged under certain relations, I call its form. But that in which our sensations are merely arranged, and by which they are susceptible of assuming a certain form, cannot be itself sensation. It is then, the matter of all phænomena that is given to us à posteriori; the form must lie ready à priori for them in the mind, and consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation. </p>

<p class='indent'>I call all representations pure, in the transcendental meaning of the word, wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation. And accordingly we find existing in the mind à priori, the pure form of sensuous intuitions in general, in which all the manifold content of the phænomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations. This pure form of sensibility I shall call pure intuition. Thus, if I take away from our representation of a body, all that the understanding thinks as belonging to it, as substance, force, divisibility, &c., and also whatever belongs to sensation, as impenetrability, hardness, colour, &c.; yet there is still something left us from this empirical intuition, namely, extension and shape. These belong to pure intuition, which exists à priori in the mind, as a mere form of sensibility, and without any real object of the senses or any sensation. </p>

<p class='indent'>The science of all the principles of sensibility à priori, I call Transcendental Æsthetic.<sup><a href="#Footnote 1">[1]</a></sup> There must, then, be such a science, forming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in contradistinction to that part which contains the principles of pure thought, and which is called transcendental logic. </p>

<p class='indent'>In the science of transcendental æsthetic accordingly, we shall first isolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty, by separating from it all that is annexed to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding, so that nothing be left but empirical intuition. In the next place we shall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, so that nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form of phænomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford à priori. From this investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of sensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge à priori, namely, space and time. To the consideration of these we shall now proceed.</p>
<br>

<p class='footnotes'><a id="Footnote 1">[1]</a> The Germans are the only people who at present use this word to indicate what others call the critique of taste. At the foundation of this term lies the disappointed hope, which the eminent analyst, Baumgarten, conceived, of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to principles of reason, and so of elevating its rules into a science. But his endeavours were vain. For the said rules or criteria are, in respect to their chief sources, merely empirical, consequently never can serve as determinate laws a priori, by which our judgement in matters of taste is to be directed. It is rather our judgement which forms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles. On this account it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating the critique of taste, and to apply it solely to that doctrine, which is true science — the science of the laws of sensibility — and thus come nearer to the language and the sense of the ancients in their well-known division of the objects of cognition into αἰσθητα και νόητα; <span class='sidenote'>αἰσθητα και νόητα might be glossed as "the objects of perception" vs. "the objects of knowledge"</span> or to share it with speculative philosophy, and employ it partly in a transcendental, partly in a psychological signification.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p class='indent'>Kant's claim that if we take if we "take away from our representation of a body all that the understanding thinks as belonging to it, as substance, force, divisibility, etc., and also whatever belongs to sensation, as impenetrability, hardness, colour, etc.; yet there is still something left us from this empirical intuition, namely, extension and shape" is reminiscent of Descartes's famous "wax" argument in the Second Meditation. There, Descartes uses the wax example to remove "whatever belongs to sensation," since this is physically changed when the wax melts. And what is leftover is, for Descartes, "something extended, flexible, and movable." Kant's unique contribution is to include time as well as space, so that the laws of mechanics are synthetic a priori truths, rather than just the laws of Cartesian geometry.</p>

<p class='indent'>Kant's method of argumentation is subtle here, because he never seems to be making any arguments. We will see this strategy throughout the Critique of Pure Reason. "I am simply establishing some distinctions, defining terms, the real argument will come later," he always seems to say. However, the real argument never comes. The entire Critique will consist of explication. It is therefore important to begin the resistance to Kant right here at the beginning, unless we want to become ensnared in the Kantian web. (Which, by the way, if you want to make sweeping claims, has ensnared Hegel and therefore Marx and therefore those vast swaths of socialists that caused all sorts of trouble in the 20th century.)</p>

<p class='indent'>Just as we rejected Descartes's postulate of a purely cognitive faculty that intuits 3-dimensional space, we should reject Kant's central premise that there is such a thing as "pure intuition." Descartes was guilty of reifying the model of 3-dimensional space (which he of course developed himself through the Cartesian coordinate system). Kant, similarly, is guilty of reifying the model of Newtonian mechanics. He takes the world of Newtonian mechanics to be true (which it isn't), and, more importantly, he takes it to be somehow "more true" than the world of ordinary experience. Commentators frequently take him at his word that his motivation was providing an answer Humean skepticism, however, I would suggest that Kant is more interested in providing a Christian worldview. He is seeking to provide an answer to materialism, rather than Humean skepticism. Just as Descartes's uses his extreme "evil demon" form of skepticism as tool to weaken our beliefs about the external world, Kant uses Humean skepticism as a sort of nihilistic bogeyman to scare us away from the materialist position. "This is what will happen to you if you embrace materialism. You will have no knowledge of the laws of nature. There will be no laws of nature. There will simply be one damned thing after another." And the endpoint for both Descartes and Kant is similar: a return to a more Platonic worldview, in which minds are the primary entities. Once we are driven to accept that we ourselves are supernatural, something more than matter, then the existence of other supernatural entities like God and Heaven are much more palatable.</p>

<p class='indent'>If we subtract all the "conceptions of understanding" (which I would call mental processing) from perceptual experiences, we are not left with some mystical connection between 3-dimensional space and our minds. Or at least it's not obvious that we would be, because it's an impossible hypothetical situation. I myself have never been able to subtract away the conceptions of understanding from my perceptions, and I cannot will myself into doing so now. We let Kant get away with too much even in his establishment of distinctions! How many readers have been lulled into acquiesence in accepting this idea simply because of the innocence of its presentation. "Oh yes, of course, if we simply subtract away the conceptions of understanding, we're still left with a pure intuition of 3-dimensional space." The truth is we have no idea what would happen if we could have a perception without any conceptualization, because our whole brain and visual system is set up to conceptualize as soon as it perceives. Perhaps the closest analog we could imagine would be the perceptions of a nonhuman animal. A songbird, for example, might have a visual system but lack the cerebral power to impose concepts on its visual experiences. But what is it like to be a songbird? It's an unanswerable question. However, I don't think Kant would want to say that songbirds have pure intuitions of space and time! I myself will withdraw to what I believe is safer ground and postulate that space and time, or rather the 3-dimensional space and the 1-dimensional time of Newtonian mechanics, are part of the conceptual framework that is imposed on our experiences when they are processed by our brains. Just as categories like "tree" and "dangerous" are imposed on them. But this does not imply at all that space and time are ideal. It only implies that our model of the universe as a 4-dimensional coordinate system is ideal. Things must have spatial relations, since their properties are sometimes dependent on them, e.g. enantiomers.</p>

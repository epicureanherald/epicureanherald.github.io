The standard way of understanding modern philosophy is that it represents a fundamental break with the scholastic philosophy that had gone before. That Galileo and other natural philosophers poked sufficient holes in the Aristotelian-Aquinean way of understanding the world to allow it to be overturned by a materialistic way of understanding the world that culminated in Newton, and gave raise to the Enlightenment in various disciplines apart from philosophy. This narrative is of course an oversimplification in various ways. For a start, the Aristotelian-Aquinean system was not at all the dominant position in Western medieval philosophy, considered as beginning in 476 with the fall of the Western Roman Empire to 1564 with the birth of Galileo. Rather, Aquinas represents merely the final stage of a medieval philosophy. And Aquinas himself was in a way forced to reconcile existing medieval philosophy with Aristotle's writings, most of which had been only recently rediscovered, due to their sheer quality.  Thus, although Descartes and Gassendi, for example, express dismay with the current state of scholasticism, and its stifling of creativity, the bulk of medieval philosophy can be better understood as an attempt to reconcile the Bible with everyday experience. The writings of the Church Fathers and post-Aquinean medieval philospohers writing on topics other than causation, hylomorphism, etc. might be rather said to occupy the bulk of medieval philosophy. And, as we will see, in many ways modern philosophy is rather a return to the Church Fathers and other medievals than a break with medieval philosophy simpliciter.  

More importantly for my purposes, this account is an oversimplification because modern philosophy did NOT embrace mechanism. That is, if we understand mechanism to mean Epicureanism, i.e., to encompass a materialistic ontology, no soul, so afterlife, no gods, no supernatural morals, etc. The refutation of the Aristotelian worldview left people searching for alternatives, and other ancient Greek and Roman authors were a ready source of inspiration. The De Rerum Natura of Lucretius was popular and in print, and yet no modern philosopher, not even Gassendi or Hobbes, was prepared to endorse Epicureanism in full, or in unmodified form. If we accept that the Epicurean position is, in its major points, true, as I do, then this poses a puzzle. Why was the truth thus suppressed by every modern philosopher? Why were modern philosophers, although innovative in other respects, so deeply conservative about certain propositions such as the existence of God and an immaterial soul? In this essay, I want to argue that the history of modern philosophy is usefully read as an unconscious avoidance of the Epicurean position. Epicureanism is center stage, although in absentia. Modern philosophy is a series of attempts to make sense of the rejection of the Aristotelian universe and the apparent truth of a mechanistic natural philosophy, while preserving core Christian beliefs such as the existence of a caring God and a life after death. As we will see, even Analytic and Continental philosophy were shaped by unconscious Christian beliefs and desires.

One easy answer to the question of why no modern philosopher endorsed Epicureanism is that he or she faced excommunication or worse by the Church, if he did so. Thus, although they pretended to endorse Christian beliefs in order to avoid persecution, they really are much more radical than they appear to be. After all, this interpretation goes, they gave birth to the contemporary, post-Christian age! Hobbes, perhaps, comes the closest to matching this interpretation. He belatedly adopts Stoic determinism in order to allow for a vehicle through which God can influence the world (Newton was to follow suit). But he never admits of the immaterial soul, and he insists that the Bible calls for bodily resurrection only. These can be seen as the least adjustments necessary, half-heartedly made, to avoid excommunication. But, if so, why did he not draft publications, to be published posthumously, that retracted these adjustments? The same can be asked for every other modern philosopher. Why are there no posthumous publications that embrace Epicureanism in toto? I want to argue, instead, that Hobbes's theism was ingenuous and that every other modern philosopher was a committed Christian. Whether their Christianity is primary, or their desire to believe in their own immortality and a God are primary, is an interesting question in itself but not material to the substance of my thesis. In either case, their powers of reasoning caused them to grasp the truth of Epicureanism, and their prior beliefs and desires caused them to immediately repress that truth. Modern philosophy is then, to speak in Freudian terms, the great sublimation that results from that repression. 

Moreover, we should not accept the premise that we are in a post-Christian age at all. As Nietzsche knew, it is nearly impossible to rid oneself of all religious beliefs. The desire that there should be magic in the world is firmly rooted in our psychology, and it - coupled with the legacy of the moderns - affects everyone from Derrida to David Lewis.

DESCARTES

Descartes's "Meditations on First Philosophy" represent the first and perhaps clearest example of my thesis that modern philosophy is an unconscious attempt to avoid Epicureanism, at any cost. Descartes opens the Second Meditation by claiming that "[s]o serious are the doubts into which I have been thrown as a result of yesterday's meditation that I can neither put them out of my mind nor see any way of resolving them. It feels as if I have fallen unexpectedly into a deep whirlpool which tumbles me around so that I can neither stand on the bottom nor swim up to the top." Descartes thus refers to the skeptical doubts for which the Meditations became famous, and to which many commentators thought he had no satisfactory response. But, if one returns to the text of the first meditation, one sees that Cartesian skepticism is very idiosyncratic and doesn't at all warrant the emotional response he describes at the start of the second meditation. 

The impetus for Descartes's skepticism is the overturning, in his lifetime, of the geocentric view of the world. Philosophical commentators tend to focus on the rejection of Aristotelian substantial forms as the most important philosophical innovation that ushered in modern philosophy. However, it's worthwhile to consider the more macroscopic view. Prior to the astronomical discoveries of the late Renaissance period, the most famous representatives of which are Copernicus and Galileo, the orthodox philosophical worldview consisted of a geocentric sphere, with Earth at the center, and the heavens consisting of a mostly homogenous, fairly uninteresting material substance, the aether. The Earth, at the center, contained a great hierarchy of living things that culminated in humans. It was a great round dollhouse for God, in other words, and it was easy to imagine Him taking a personal interest in all the various goings-on of His little creations. Nietzsche has focused on Christianity's undervaluing and rejection of the material world in favor of the afterlife. But this is not the correct way of understanding the medieval Catholic Christianity in which Descartes was raised. (It rather corresponds to the more modern Lutheran and Calvinist forms of Christianity, which focused on the Platonic elements of Christianity.) The Earth is an important, perfectly-ordered creation at the center of God's concerns. 

After the discoveries of the astronomers, however, this worldview has been refuted. The universe instead consists of a vast void, through which tiny planets, comets, and stars a moving. Plato, Aristotle, the Church Fathers have been shown to be wrong about the fundamental order of the universe. Instead, the ancient Atomists, Epicureans, and Stoics have been shown to be right.

This is the context, I would suggest, in which we should read Descartes's statement at the beginning of the first Meditation that "[s]ome years ago I was struck by the large number of falsehoods that I had accepted as true in my childhood, and by the highly doubtful nature of the whole edifice that I had subsequently based on them. I realized that it was necessary, once in the course of my life, to demolish everything completely and start again right from the foundations..." This demolishing takes the form of Cartesian skepticism, but the metaphor is an apt one for what has happened to Aristotelian geocentric worldview. 

Descartes actually quickly refutes, or at least rebuts, the "dream skepticism" with which he is popularly associated. He claims that, even if the particulars of the "dream" are false, the underlying principles would remain true. "So," he writes, "a reasonable conclusion from this might be that...arithmetic, geometry, and other subjects of this kind...contain something certain and indubitable. For whether I am awake or asleep, two and three added together are five..." It is at this point that his skepticism takes an unusual turn. He raises the possibility that God is deceiving him into believing false versions of the a priori propositions he described above, for example that God deceives him into "go[ing] wrong every time I add two and three." This, Descartes admits, would be inconsistent with God's supreme goodness. But, rather shockingly, Descartes claims that all sensory illusions are inconsistent with God's supreme goodness, and yet they exist. 

At this point, Descartes suggests that atheists are able to avoid the unusual form of skepticism he has laid out. Thus, an atheist may be susceptible to skepticism about a posteriori truths (based on dream skepticism), but not skepticism about a priori truths, since there would be no omnipotent being capable of deceiving one about a priori truths. Thus he says that "perhaps there may be some who would prefer to deny the existence of so powerful a God rather than believe that everything else is uncertain." However, Descartes immediately contradicts himself. Conjuring the Stoic and Epicurean worldviews, respectively, he writes that "[a]ccording to their supposition, then, I have arrived at my present state by fate or chance or a continuous chain of events, or by some other means." He then argues that these origins are likely to endow humans with infallible judgement, even about a priori truths: "yes since deception and error seem to be imperfections, the less powerful they [i.e., the Epicureans and Stoics] make my original cause, the more likely it is that I am so imperfect as to be deceived all the time." His final chain of skeptical arguments in the first meditation might therefore be summarized as follows:

(1) One is unable to distinguish between dreams and reality, therefore one may always be in error about statements of particular fact, e.g. "There is a keyboard in front of me."
(2) Either there is a God or there isn't.
(3) If there is a God, He may be deceiving me about a priori propositions, e.g. "2 + 2 = 4."
(4) If there isn't a God, there is nothing to guarantee that my faculties perfectly latch on to the truth, even about a priori propositions.
(5) Thus, in either case, one may always be in error about a priori propositions.

The peculiar feature of Descartes's skeptical arguments (putting aside their plausibility for the moment) is that he appears to take them on the chin like a good empiricist. It is an almost Quinean response. The correct answer to skeptical arguments is always to resist the skeptic's implicit premise that his doubts necessitate raising our standards for what counts as knowledge. Thus, the proper response to Descartes's argument that God might be deceiving us about "2 + 2 = 4" is not to say that we do not know that "2 + 2 = 4." It's to accept, with due humility, that no knowledge is absolutely certain and that the definition of the word "to know" is not equivalent to "to be absolutely certain about." Of course, that does not mean that we should not attempt to rebut the skeptic's arguments on their face as well. But that is the subject of another essay.

What concerns us here is that Descartes retreats to a stable, commonsense position: "I shall never get out of the habit of confidently assenting to these opinions, so long as I suppose them to be what in fact they are, namely highly probable opinions -- opinions which, despite the fact tha they are in a sense doubtful, as has just been shown, it is still much more reasonable to believe than to deny." His subsequent skepticism - the celebrated evil demon scenario - is the result of a deliberate effort to think of ways to undermine his commonsense beliefs. "It will be a good plan," he writes, "to turn my will in completely the opposite direction and deceive myself, by pretending for a time that these former opinions are utterly false and imaginary." (This response is actually more persuasive that the one he reaches at the end of the Mediations, that God exists and His infinite goodness entails that skepticism is unwarranted. Mersenne showed this rebuttal to be unsatisfying, since it leads to the infamous Cartesian circle.) But notice how incongruous this is with the beginning of the second meditation...

Anglo-American historians of philosophy have tended to understand Descartes's cogito as the fundamental premise of a grand argument that Descartes will build on to create his philosophical system. They are influenced by the Analytic tradition, on which everything is a proposition. It is more apt, however, to interpret it as physical retreat into the human mind. Descartes cedes the ground of the external world, since, with the refutation of the Geocentric world of substantial forms, it has been shown to be an Atomistic wasteland, devoid of inherent value or religious significance. Instead, he retreats into the last entity that is not clearly material, the human "soul." Moreover, Descartes is happy to cede that ground, and he enlists his demon in order to do so, because he is only interested in affirming the Christian worldview in a way that accommodates the recent triumphs of Atomism.

Descartes's true skeptical doubts are not about the veracity of his sense impressions. They are about the truth of the Christianity. The Scholastic worldview has been shown to be false. Why should not the rest of theology be false as well? Thus, Descartes needs arguments that will reassure himself of his belief in God and the immortal soul. Cartesian dualism is nothing more than an attempt to salvage these two, God and soul, from the mechanistic abyss into which the external world has been plunged.

With Descartes, philosophy crawled into the self, and it has not emerged since.

The Continental philosophers deserve the greatest contempt, because one feels that philosophy is for them a sort of conceptual world-building or an agonistic art. But I came to you to hear the truth. Philosophy is not a game.

The standard way of understanding modern philosophy is that it represents a fundamental break with the scholastic philosophy that had gone before. That Galileo and other natural philosophers poked sufficient holes in the Aristotelian-Aquinean way of understanding the world to allow it to be overturned by a materialistic way of understanding the world that culminated in Newton, and gave raise to the Enlightenment in various disciplines apart from philosophy. This narrative is of course an oversimplification in various ways. For a start, the Aristotelian-Aquinean system was not at all the dominant position in Western medieval philosophy, considered as beginning in 476 with the fall of the Western Roman Empire to 1564 with the birth of Galileo. Rather, Aquinas represents merely the final stage of a medieval philosophy. And Aquinas himself was in a way forced to reconcile existing medieval philosophy with Aristotle's writings, most of which had been only recently rediscovered, due to their sheer quality.  Thus, although Descartes and Gassendi, for example, express dismay with the current state of scholasticism, and its stifling of creativity, the bulk of medieval philosophy can be better understood as an attempt to reconcile the Bible with everyday experience. The writings of the Church Fathers and post-Aquinean medieval philospohers writing on topics other than causation, hylomorphism, etc. might be rather said to occupy the bulk of medieval philosophy. And, as we will see, in many ways modern philosophy is rather a return to the Church Fathers and other medievals than a break with medieval philosophy simpliciter.  

More importantly for my purposes, this account is an oversimplification because modern philosophy did NOT embrace mechanism. That is, if we understand mechanism to mean Epicureanism, i.e., to encompass a materialistic ontology, no soul, so afterlife, no gods, no supernatural morals, etc. The refutation of the Aristotelian worldview left people searching for alternatives, and other ancient Greek and Roman authors were a ready source of inspiration. The De Rerum Natura of Lucretius was popular and in print, and yet no modern philosopher, not even Gassendi or Hobbes, was prepared to endorse Epicureanism in full, or in unmodified form. If we accept that the Epicurean position is, in its major points, true, as I do, then this poses a puzzle. Why In this essay, I want to

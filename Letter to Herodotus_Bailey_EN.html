<p class="indent">[35] For those who are unable, Herodotus, to work in detail through all that I have written about nature, or to peruse the larger books which I have composed, I have already prepared at sufficient length an epitome of the whole system, that they may keep adequately in mind at least the most general principles in each department, in order that as occasion arises they may be able to assist themselves on the most important points, in so far as they undertake the study of nature. But those also who have made considerable progress in the survey of the main principles ought to bear in mind the scheme of the whole system set forth in its essentials. For we have frequent need of the general view, but not so often of the detailed exposition. [36] Indeed it is necessary to go back on the main principles, and constantly to fix in one's memory enough to give one the most essential comprehension of the truth. And in fact the accurate knowledge of details will be fully discovered, if the general principles in the various departments are thoroughly grasped and borne in mind, for even in the case of one fully initiated the most essential feature in all accurate knowledge is the capacity to make a rapid use of observation and mental apprehension, and &lt;this can be done if everything&gt; is summed up in elementary principles and formulae. For it is not possible for any one to abbreviate the complete course through the whole system, if he cannot embrace in his own mind by means of short formulae all that might be set out with accuracy in detail. [37] Wherefore since the method I have described is valuable to all those who are accustomed to the investigation of nature, I who urge upon others the constant occupation in the investigation of nature, and find my own peace chiefly in a life so occupied, have composed for you another epitome on these lines, summing up the first principles of the whole doctrine.</p>

<p class="indent">First of all, Herodotus, we must grasp the ideas attached to words, in order that we may be able to refer to them and so to judge the inferences of opinion or problems of be used in investigation or reflection, so that we may not either leave everything uncertain and go on explaining to infinity or use words devoid of meaning. [38] For this purpose it is essential that the first mental image associated with each word should be regarded, and that there should be no need of explanation, if we are really to have a standard to which to refer a problem of investigation or reflection or a mental inference. And besides we must keep all our investigations in accord with our sensations, and in particular with the immediate apprehensions whether of the mind or of any one of the instruments of judgement, and likewise in accord with the feelings existing in us, in order that we may have indications whereby we may judge both the problem of sense-perception and the unseen.</p>


<p class="indent">Having made these points clear, we must now consider things imperceptible to the senses. First of all, that nothing is created out of that which does not exist: for if it were, everything would be created out of everything with no need of seeds. [39] And again, if that which disappears were destroyed into that which did not exist, all things would have perished, since that into which they were dissolved would not exist. Furthermore, the universe always was such as it is now, and always will be the same. For there is nothing into which it changes: for outside the universe there is nothing which could come into it and bring about the change.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, the universe is (bodies and space): for that bodies exist sense itself witnesses in the experience of all men, and in accordance with the evidence of sense we must of necessity judge of the imperceptible by reasoning, as I have already said. [40] And if there were not that which we term void and place and intangible existence, bodies would have nowhere to exist and nothing through which to move, as they are seen to move. And besides these two nothing can even be thought of either by conception or on the analogy of things conceivable such as could be grasped as whole existences and not spoken of as the accidents or properties of such existences. Furthermore, among bodies some are compounds, and others those of which compounds are formed. [41] And these latter are indivisible and unalterable (if, that is, all things are not to be destroyed into the non-existent, but something permanent is to remain behind at the dissolution of compounds) they are completely solid in nature, and can by no means be dissolved in any part. So it must needs be that the first-beginnings are indivisible corporeal existences.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, the universe is boundless. For that which is bounded has an extreme point, and the extreme point is seen against something else. So that as it has no extreme point, it has no limit, and as it has no limit, it must be boundless and not bounded. [42] Furthermore, the infinite is boundless both in the number of the bodies and in the extent of the void. For if on the one hand the void were boundless, and the bodies limited in number, the bodies could not stay anywhere, but would be carried about and scattered through the infinite void, not having other bodies to support them and keep them in place by means of collisions. But if, on the other hand, the void were limited, the infinite bodies would not have room wherein to take their place.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides this the indivisible and solid bodies, out of which too the compounds are created and into which they are dissolved, have an incomprehensible number of varieties in shape for it is not possible that such great varieties of things should arise from the same (atomic) shapes, if they are limited in number. And so in each shape the atoms are quite infinite in number, but their differences of shape are not quite infinite, but only incomprehensible in number.</p>

<p class="indent">[43] And the atoms move continuously for all time, some of them (falling straight down, others swerving, and others recoiling from their collisions. And of the latter, some are borne on) separating to a long distance from one another, while others again recoil and recoil, whenever they chance to be checked by the interlacing with others, or else shut in by atoms interlaced around them. [44] For on the one hand the nature of the void which separates each atom by itself brings this about, as it is not able to afford resistance, and on the other hand the hardness which belongs to the atoms makes them recoil after collision to as great a distance as the interlacing permits separation after the collision. And these motions have no beginning, since the atoms and the void are the cause.</p> 

45 These brief sayings, if all these points are borne in mind, 
afford a sufficient outline for our understanding of the 
nature of existing things. 

Furthermore, there are infinite worlds both like and F Infimte 
unlike this world of ours. For the atoms being infinite in ee δι 
number, as was proved already, are borne on far out into 
space. For those atoms, which are of such nature that 
a world could be created out of them or made by them, 
have not been used up either on one world or on a limited 
number of worlds, nor again on all the worlds which are 
alike, or on those which are different from these. So that 
there nowhere exists an obstacle to the infinite number of 
the worlds.

sort which pass from us to them—nearly so well as if 
models, similar in colour and shape, leave the objects and 
enter according to their respective size either into our 
50 sight or into our mind, moving along swiftly, and so by 
this means reproducing the image of a single continuous 
thing and preserving the corresponding sequence of quall- 
ties and movements from the original object as the result 
of their uniform contact with us, kept up by the vibration 
of the atoms deep in the interio: of the concrete body. 
And every image which we obtain by an act of appre- 5 Truth and 
᾿ falsehood in 
hension on the part of the mind or of the sense-organs, vision, 
whether of shape or of properties, this image 1s the shape 
cor the properties) of the concrete object, and 1s produced by 
the constant repetition of the image or the impression it has 
left. Now falsehood and error always he in the addition 
of opinion with regard to (what 1s waiting) to be confirmed 
or not contradicted, and then is not confirmed (or is con- 
δι tradicted). For the similarity between the things which 
exist, which we call real, and the images received as a 
likeness of things and produced either in sleep or through 
some other acts of apprehension on the part of the mind 
or the other instruments of judgement, could never be, 
unless there were some effluences of this nature actually 
brought into contact with our senses. And error would 
not exist unless another kind of movement too were pro- 
duced inside ourselves, closely linked to the apprehension 
of images, but differing from it, and it 1s owing to this, 
supposing it 1s not confirmed, or 1s contradicted, that false- 
hood arises, but if it is confirmed or not contradicted, it 
52 15 true. Therefore we must do our best to keep this doc- 
trine in mind, in order that on the one hand the standards 
of judgement dependent on the clear visions may not be 
undermined, and on the other error may not be as firmly 
established as truth and so throw all into confusion.

55 For even in things perceptible to us which change their 
shape by the withdrawal of matter it is seen that shape 
remains to them, whereas the qualities do not remain in 
the changing object, in the way in which shape is left 
behind, but are lost from the entire body. Now these 
particles which are left behind are sufficient to cause the 
differences 1n compound bodies, since it is essential that 
some things should be left behind and not be destroyed 
into the non-existent, 

Moreover, we must not either suppose that every size a The atoms 
exists among the atoms, in order that the evidence of πᾶνε νά εῖοῦ 
phenomena may not contradict us, but we must suppose not all’sizes. 
that there are some variations of size. For if this be the ee 
case, we can give a better account of what occurs in our visible 

56 feelings and sensations. But the existence of atoms of 
every size is not required to explain the differences of 
qualities in things, and at the same time some atoms 
would be bound to come within our ken and be visible, 
but this is never seen to be the case, nor is it possible 
to imagine how an atom could become visible. 

Besides this we must not suppose that in a limited body B The parts 
there can be infinite parts or parts of every degree of he behion 
smallness. Therefore, we must not only do away with οἵ ἃ limited 
division into smaller and smaller parts to infinity, in order Lage ethane 
that we may not make all things weak, and so in the com- number or 
position of aggregate bodies be compelled to crush and phaitely 
squander the things that exist into the non-existent, but 
we must not either suppose that in limited bodies there 
is a possibility of continuing to infinity in passing even to 

57 smaller and smaller parts. For if once one says that For, if they 
there are infinite parts in a body or parts of any degree a (4) ae 
of smallness, it is not possible to conceive how this should pe Vaated in 
be, and indeed how could the body any longer be limited size, 
in size? (For it is obvious that these infinite particles 
must be of some size or other; and however small they 
may be, the size of the body too would be infinite.) And and (6) 1 the 
again, since the limited body has an extreme point, which ar

one point to another, it should be possible for you to 
proceed to infinity marking such points in your mind. 
We must notice also that the least thing in sensation is α The mum- 
neither exactly hke that which admuts of progression from [win usible ᾿ 
one part to another, nor again is it in every respect wholly without parts 
unlike it, but it has a certain affinity with such bodies,

of this resemblance we think to divide off parts of it, one 
on the one side and another on the other, it must needs 
be that another point like the first meets our view And

greater body and fewer in a smaller. Now we must Similarly, 
suppose that the least part in the atom too bears the same tein, 
relation to the whole; for though in smallness it is obvious visible parts 
that it exceeds that which is seen by sensation, yet it has '" the atom, 
the same relations. For indeed we have already declared 
on the ground of its relation to sensible bodies that the 
atom has size, only we placed it far below them in small- 
ness. Further, we must consider these least indivisible which are the 
points as boundary-marks, providing in themselves as το aie 
primary units the measure of size for the atoms, both for 
the smaller and the greater, in our contemplation of these 
unseen bodies by means of thought. For the affinity 
which the least parts of the atom have to the homogeneous 
parts (of sensible things) 1s sufficient to justify our con- 
clusion to this extent. but that they should ever come 
together as bodies with motion is quite impossible. 

[Furthermore, in the infinite we must not speak of ‘up’ (In what

For the addition of opinion with regard to the unseen,

the outward expression of its internal collisions, even

of advantage to grasp this first principle as well.

that when according to the most general usage we employ 

this name, we make it clear that accidents have neither 

the nature of the whole, which we comprehend in its 
aggregate and call body, nor that of the qualities which 
permanently accompany it, without which a given body 

cannot be conceived. But as the result of certain acts ot 
apprehension, provided the aggregate body goes along 

with them, they might each be given this name, but only on 
occasions when each one of them 1s seen to occur, since 
accidents are not permanent accompaniments. And we Both their

to them and to the permanent properties), but, just as it

I plan to create readable versions of primary philosophical texts, particularly Atomist and Epicurean texts, with the original language text on one column and the best (public domain) English translation on the other, and with the ability to mouseover a non-English word to see a translation. I also plan to create commentaries on the central works of Modern Philosophy, with the aim of demonstrating that Christian beliefs permeate them, even in more recent Analytic and Continental philosophical works, which are often thought to be atheistic. Finally, I plan to create a online version of the Theophrastus redivivus, in order to highlight an alternative route Modern Philosophy might have taken.

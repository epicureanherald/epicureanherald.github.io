The dream is to amass a pile of knowledge so high that we may sit at the top, untroubled and out of reach.

Man has become too much an artistic creature, and he seeks to live his life as though he were in an art-from. An Epicurean maxim might therefore be the denial of Aristotle's maxim that "probable impossibilities should be preferred to improbable possibilities." This may be true in art, where the narrative logic should trump physical possibility or even logical possibility. But in life, probable possibilities are the best. If there are none, then improbable possibilities. Reject all impossibilities. Though the narrative flow of your life may suggest that you have an immortal soul, and that there is a beneficent deity that will take care of you, even after your death, these claims are physically impossible, and thus should be rejected.

Perhaps fiction itself is to blame for the Stoic world view of causal determinism. People became so accustomed to the idea of an authored universe, where every event has been foreshadowed and is the result of an overarching intention that they began to see the universe itself that way. It's difficult to see how one would arrive at the Leibnizian view that this is the best of all possible worlds using only the evidence of the real world. A layer of fictional ontology must always be between us and our experience of the real world if we are to find that view plausible.

If one could go back in time and teach Marcus Aurelius about the fallacy called "ignoratio elenchi through high redefinition," they could spare his readers, including myself, much torment in having to read over and over about the meaninglessness of our lives when considered from the standpoint of eternity, etc.

Perhaps space is not an existent thing but rather arises out of objects. Thus, the weaker gravitational attraction between two bodies is the primary existent, the apparently empty space between them only a different way of expressing the former. And perhaps time too has no independent existence. Rather, a raised object's attraction to the Earth is primary and the apparent passage of time as it falls is only a different way of expressing the lapse of time as it falls.

"The influence of Pomponazzi was strongly felt by Lucilius Vanini (1585-1619), who was strangled and burnt as a heretic at Toulouse. He was the author of an Amphitheatrum aeternae providentiae (1615) and of a De admirandis naturae reginae deaeque mortalium arcanis libri quator (1616). He seems to have embraced a kind of pantheism, though he was accused of atheism, which he was said to have dissembled in his first work." (Copleston, Volume III, pp.226-7)

"The closest thing is a preachy private letter written in 1429 in defence of Epicurus by humanist Cosma Raimondi (1400–35/6) to a friend. The Neoplatonist Marsilio Ficino (1433–99) in his youth wrote an essay On Pleasure, only to repudiate it, and a short commentary on Lucretius, which he condemned to the flames. He later confessed: I have always taken so much care not to spread any impious doctrine, that even my little commentaries on Lucretius, which I wrote – I do not know how – when I was still a boy, I did not save then; in fact I gave them to Vulcan."

"Lorenzo Valla (1406/7–57) also wrote a philosophical dialogue titled On Pleasure in his mid-twenties. The work articulates the Epicurean position – without once mentioning Lucretius – only to reject it in favour of a hedonistic Christianity."

"Palpable traces of Lucretian influence on the Renaissance are limited to a few curious readers, and they are not without interest. Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) is the best-known, and most sophisticated, Renaissance reader. The political philosopher, who copied, corrected and annotated his own manuscript of De Rerum Natura (now in the Vatican Library), may have developed his astringent political realism from the Lucretian vision of a godless universe."

"Luke Slattery is an Australian writer, editor and critic. His work has appeared in the New Yorker, LA Times, Times Literary Supplement, Philosophy Now, and the Spectator. He is the author of four books of non-fiction including Reclaiming Epicurus (Penguin, London, 2012) and a novel titled Mrs M (Fourth Estate, Sydney, 2017). He is working on a book about Pico Della Mirandola. A detailed account of the transmission of Lucretius from antiquity to the Renaissance is given in David Butterfield’s The Early Textual History of Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura (Cambridge UP, 2013); further details about Epicureanism in the 15th century may be found in Catherine Wilson’s Epicureanism at the Origins of Modernity (Oxford UP, 2009), Alison Brown’s The Return of Lucretius to Renaissance Florence (Harvard UP, Cambridge, MA), and Ada Palmer’s Lucretius in the Renaissance (Harvard UP, Cambridge, MA, 2014). My own book Reclaiming Epicurus (Penguin, London, 2012) offers a broader survey of Epicureanism, For those wanting something a little different, Karl Marx’s doctorate on Epicurus and Democritus may be read here https://marxists.architexturez.net/archive/marx/works/1841/dr-theses/ch02.htm."

Epicureanism is the Cartesian demon. The doubts were Descartes's own about his Christianity. Modern philosophy is a reaction against this demon.

Comparison between the truth of Epicureanism and Kato Kalen's knowledge of what was happening outside his trailer, as in the Gary Schandling joke.

The fundamental mistake of analytic philosophy is the same as that of the young Wittgenstein: to suppose that the world is composed out of facts or propositions. Attempting to break down concepts into their elemental components is a fools errand, because concepts are vague, unstable, non-universal brain states that have a high (but not perfect) degree of overlap amongst people. Imagine then attempting to learn something about a semi-shared brain state by examining other brain states that overlap with it. We are learning something about how the neurons organize and form connections, but nothing about the world outside our heads.

The desire to retain incorporeal substances of some kind by philosophers (for without them, what would the purpose of philosophers be?) is so strong that they will readily accept such a flimsy argument against physicalism as: "Yes, but can you give be a rigorous account of what counts as physical and what doesn't?" As though any concept can be rigorously defined! Is this 400 B.C.? What we mean by physicalism: no forms, no souls, no gods, no states of affairs, no phenomena (in the Kantian sense), no laws of nature; in short, no magic!

The dream is to amass a pile of knowledge so high that we may sit at the top, untroubled and out of reach.

Man has become too much an artistic creature, and he seeks to live his life as though he were in an art-from. An Epicurean maxim might therefore be the denial of Aristotle's maxim that "probable impossibilities should be preferred to improbable possibilities." This may be true in art, where the narrative logic should trump physical possibility or even logical possibility. But in life, probable possibilities are the best. If there are none, then improbable possibilities. Reject all impossibilities. Though the narrative flow of your life may suggest that you have an immortal soul, and that there is a beneficent deity that will take care of you, even after your death, these claims are physically impossible, and thus should be rejected.

Perhaps fiction itself is to blame for the Stoic world view of causal determinism. People became so accustomed to the idea of an authored universe, where every event has been foreshadowed and is the result of an overarching intention that they began to see the universe itself that way. It's difficult to see how one would arrive at the Leibnizian view that this is the best of all possible worlds using only the evidence of the real world. A layer of fictional ontology must always be between us and our experience of the real world if we are to find that view plausible.

If one could go back in time and teach Marcus Aurelius about the fallacy called "ignoratio elenchi through high redefinition," they could spare his readers, including myself, much torment in having to read over and over about the meaninglessness of our lives when considered from the standpoint of eternity, etc.

Perhaps space is not an existent thing but rather arises out of objects. Thus, the weaker gravitational attraction between two bodies is the primary existent, the apparently empty space between them only a different way of expressing the former. And perhaps time too has no independent existence. Rather, a raised object's attraction to the Earth is primary and the apparent passage of time as it falls is only a different way of expressing the lapse of time as it falls.

Heidegger rightly points out that, as a psychological matter, objects are usually perceived by humans in terms of their usefulness. Thus a hammer is perceived not as a massive object composed of steel and wood, but as a tool, used for hammering. He incorrectly makes a metaphysical thesis out of this, by implying that, because conscious experience is the fundamental basis of knowledge about the world, the hammer is a tool to the same degree, or even to a greater degree, than it is a collection of iron and carbon particles, i.e., the physical understanding of the item. How do I know that the physical understanding is primary? Well, using physics and chemistry, I can go away and make a flavorless, odorless pill that can end Heidegger's (or his leader's) conscious experience forever. But I cannot use my conscious experience to make any physical changes whatsoever. In Heidegger's world, telekinesis should be possible. But it isn't. In the real world, I can die in my own house without any foreknowledge or conscious experience, simply from a carbon monoxide leak.

But, back to the psychology, whenever our ancestors encountered a natural landscape or event outside of their day-to-day concerns, it nevertheless retained this quality of "being-for."

We should not accept the premise that "incorporeal object" is a coherent premise without argument. Sherlock Holmes is an abstract object. But the theists say that God is abstract object that exists outside the mind.
